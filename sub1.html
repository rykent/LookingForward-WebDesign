			<h1>Biking</h1>
			<p>Restrictions of the shelter in place order are lifting allowing us to go further away from our houses. I'm looking forward to this because then I can go to more trails and not the same ones over and over again. It will also be good to have a way to exercise and biking is fun for me.</p>
